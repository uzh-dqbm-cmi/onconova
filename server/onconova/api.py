Welcome to the Onconova API — a secure, standards-based interface designed to facilitate the exchange, management, and 
analysis of research data related to cancer genomics, clinical records, and associated metadata. This API provides an extensive set of RESTful endpoints enabling authorized users to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various resources within the platform’s data ecosystem.

The primary objective of this API is to support precision oncology research by enabling interoperability between data systems, promoting data sharing among research institutions, and streamlining workflows for clinical and genomic data management in a secure, authenticated environment.

### Authentication
To ensure the security and integrity of cancer research data, **all API requests require proper authentication**.

A valid session token must be obtained prior to accessing any protected endpoint. This token must be included in the request header `X-Session-Token`.

The authentication and authorization flows for obtaining and managing session tokens are provided through the AllAuth authentication service. 
This includes endpoints for user login, logout, password management, and token renewal. For complete details on implementing authentication and 
managing session tokens, please refer to the [AllAuth API documentation](https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/headless/openapi-specification/).

**Important:** Unauthorized requests or those missing valid authentication tokens will receive an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response.

### Terminologies 
Many resources take objects of the type `CodedConcept` to represent concepts from coded terminologies. Each property of the type `CodedConcept` in a schema will have an associated `x-terminology` attribute. The full list of `CodedConcept` objects allowed for specific resource properties can be retrieved through the [terminology endpoint](#tag/Terminology/operation/getTerminologyConcepts) by passing the `x-terminology` value as the `terminologyName` parameter.
