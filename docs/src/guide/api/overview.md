## What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software systems to communicate with each other. 

In simpler terms:

- **For non-technical users:** Think of it like a waiter in a restaurant. You (the user) tell the waiter (API) what you want, the waiter takes your request to the kitchen (the server/database), and then brings the result back to you.
- **In Onconova:** The API allows external systems, scripts, or applications to securely interact with the Onconova database, retrieving information or submitting new data without directly accessing the database itself.

APIs are commonly used to:

- **Fetch information** (like patient records or clinical records)
- **Create new entries** (like adding a new patient or a new treatment)
- **Update existing records**
- **Delete data** (with appropriate permissions)

## Purpose

The Onconova platform provides **two complementary API interfaces** for different interoperability needs:

### REST API (This Interface)

The Onconova REST API serves as a controlled gateway for general application integration and research workflows. It enables users and integrated applications to:

- **Query data sources** and obtain both raw and aggregated clinical and genomic data
- **Create new records** within the system such as patients, reports, or terminology entries
- **Retrieve aggregated insights** from processed data sets
- **Integrate research tools** and analytical pipelines with Onconova's anonymized datasets

This interface provides **fully anonymized data** and is particularly useful for:

- Research data extraction pipelines
- Analytics and reporting applications
- Custom research applications
- Third-party research tool integrations

### FHIR Interface

In addition, Onconova offers a **[FHIR-compliant interface](fhir.md)** designed specifically for healthcare system integration:

- **Standards-based interoperability** using HL7 FHIR R4
- **Healthcare system integration** with EHRs and clinical systems
- **Pseudonymized data access** for authorized clinical workflows
- **FHIR resource profiles** tailored for oncology research

The FHIR interface requires **elevated permissions** and is intended for:

- Electronic Health Record (EHR) integrations
- Clinical decision support systems
- Healthcare workflow automation
- Multi-institutional research collaborations

!!! tip "Choosing the Right Interface"

    - **Use the REST API** for research applications, analytics, and general data access with anonymized data
    - **Use the FHIR Interface** for healthcare system integrations and clinical workflows requiring pseudonymized data

## Specification

The API is specified according to the **OpenAPI 3.1 standard**..  All endpoints, parameters, request/response formats, and data schemas are documented and interactively available through this live documentation interface.
A static reference version is also available in the [API Specification](specification.md) section of this documentation.

By adhering to the OpenAPI 3.1 standard, Onconova provides a formal, machine-readable definition of the API structure. This enables a wide range of tools and workflows for integrators, developers, and analysts:
You can automatically generate fully functional, typed client libraries in a variety of programming languages using OpenAPI code generation tools such as:

- **[OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)**
- **Swagger Codegen**
- **Stoplight Studio**
- **Postman (for importing and testing)**

Supported languages and frameworks include:

- Python (e.g. `python-requests`, `pydantic`, `fastapi-clients`)
- JavaScript / TypeScript (e.g. `axios`, `fetch` clients)
- Java, C#, Go, Ruby, and others

This allows developers to:

- Avoid manual implementation of API requests and models.
- Automatically enforce request/response validation and typing.
- Stay synchronized with evolving API schemas through regeneration.

## Authentication

To maintain security and confidentiality, all API requests must be authenticated.
Onconova uses a **session-based token authentication** mechanism. This means you must include a valid session token in your API requests' headers.

Check the [Authentication Guide](../security/authentication.md) for details on how to authenticate HTTP requests to the Onconova API.

## API Generation, Versioning, and Implications for Integrators

The Onconova API is **automatically generated from the database schema** using the server’s schema introspection capabilities. However, to maintain stability and support external integrations, the API is exposed through **explicit, versioned endpoints**. 

The Onconova API follows a **semantic versioning strategy** with clearly defined major, minor, and patch versions:
```
/api/v1/
```

- `v1` indicates the current major API version.
- Changes to the database schema are mapped to versioned API changes based on their impact:
    * **Non-breaking additions** (e.g., new optional fields, new endpoints) are applied to the current version.
    * **Breaking changes** (e.g., removing fields, changing required parameters, altering response structures) trigger the release of a **new major API version** (e.g., `v2`).

This ensures that:

- Existing integrations targeting `/api/v1/` remain stable and functional, even as the underlying database evolves.
- Integrators can migrate to newer API versions on their own schedule, without being forced to update immediately.

    Each API version maintains its own documentation and endpoint namespace.

#### Implications for Consumers and Integrators

Advantages

- **Stability through Versioning:** Integrations built against a specific API version (e.g. `/api/v1/`) remain compatible, even as new schema changes or features are introduced in `/api/v2/`.
- **Up-to-date Documentation:** Every API version maintains its own interactive documentation at `/api/vX/docs/`, reflecting the state of that version.
- **Predictable Upgrade Path:** Breaking changes are confined to new major versions, so integrators can plan migrations when ready.

Considerations

- **Deprecation Policy:** Older API versions may be deprecated and removed after a defined support period. Integrators should monitor release notes for deprecation notices.
- **Version-Specific Behavior:** Behavior, response formats, and available fields may differ between API versions. Integrators should consult the documentation for their target version.
- **Migration Planning:** Major API updates will require integrators to review changelogs, test applications against new versions, and adapt to any breaking changes.

#### Best Practices for Integrators

- Always **target a specific API version** in your integrations.
- Regularly check the `/api/vX/docs/` endpoint for your version’s specification and updates.
- Subscribe to Onconova system release notes for notifications about new versions or deprecations.
- Plan for integration testing whenever migrating to a newer API version.
- Avoid hardcoding assumptions about optional fields or undocumented behavior.
